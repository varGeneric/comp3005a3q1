the .NET 8 SDK, precompiled binaries are available in the GitHub releases in
this repository.

PostgreSQL is also required. See https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-install.html

# Running

Create the schema and default entries by running the file `db_creation.sql`
against your postgres database.

With the `dotnet` command added to your path, run

`dotnet run [postgres connection string]`

from within the repository directory. For example,

`dotnet run "Host=localhost;Username=postgres;Password=postgres;Database=3005A3Q1"`
